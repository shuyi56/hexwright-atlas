# Hexwright Atlas

A procedural, hand-drawn-style hex-map atlas. Give it a seed and it generates a fantasy realm
(terrain, rivers, roads, settlements, names) on a canvas, and lets you "enter" any city to see an
isometric district map.

## Scripts

| Command           | What it does                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Install dependencies            |
| `npm run dev`     | Start the Vite dev server       |
| `npm run build`   | Production build into `dist/`   |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build      |
| `npm run lint`    | Lint `src/` with ESLint         |

Requires Node 18+.

## Layout

```
index.html            App shell (markup + font links)
src/
  main.js             Boot: wires up the app and loads the first realm
  styles/main.css     All styles
  core/               Hex geometry, seeded RNG + noise, name generators
  world/              Biome data and the realm generator (terrain, rivers, settlements)
  render/             Canvas painting of the realm map
                      (relief, trees, terrain, settlements, rivers/roads, base compositor)
  city/               City districts: generation, architecture solids, 2.5D rendering
  ui/                 Shared state, map drawing, view/pan/zoom, input, ledger panel, city view
legacy/               The original single-file artifact, kept for reference
```

`src/ui/state.js` holds the mutable view state (`state.z`, `state.ox`, `state.map`, ...) that the
UI modules share.
